# This is the third output file that the C program generates. The comments
# are inserted here for explanation puroses, and your program is not expected
# to produce comments in output file.
# The first line contains the system size in hexadecimal. Assuming A and b from
# the input file, then we have the following outputs:
# The value of N in hexadecimal
2
# Then the values of x vector, one element per line, in hexadecimal 
# format (2's complement representation) 
f4d6
24594
# That's it! So your generated output should contain only three lines:
# one line for N, and N lines for x.
