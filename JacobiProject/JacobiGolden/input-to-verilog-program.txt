# Comments should not be used in this file and they are shown in 
# this example just to explain the different parts of this output file.
# This is an output file that is generated after executing the C program
# that solves the NxN linear system. This file conveys the same information
# as the original input file, but it is more suitable for the Verilog test
# bench. The only difference is in reporting the used scale, which is done
# solely for documentation purposes, and shall be ignored by the Verilog 
# test bench.
# The first line contains the SCALE (design parameter)
16
# The rest of the file is exactly in the same order and structure as the
# original input, but the number system used is hexadecimal. In the following,
# we list N, number of iterations, threshold, A, and b, for the same example
# that is shown in the input file (without the comments)
