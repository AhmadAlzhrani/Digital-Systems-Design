# This is an input file for the C program that solves a system
# of NxN equations (Ax = b) using the Jacobi iterative method.
# The system expects a diagonally-dominant matrix A; otherwise,
# the program rejects solving the system, since it may diverge.
# In this input file, any line starting with a pound sign (#) is considered
# a comment and is ignored by the program.
# The first input provided is the system size, N. N should be provided 
# in decimal basis and must be an integer satisfying 1<N<201.
# Here is an example of N for defining a 2x2 system:
2
# Next is the maximum number of iterations to perform before reporting 
# the result. This also must be an integer and in decimal basis.
# Here is an example:
5
# Next is the threshold, th, at which when the new solution x[k] differs
# by an absolute amount that is less than th, the program stops and 
# reports the result. This parameter is input in floating-point format.
# Here is an example:
0.005
# This means that whenever the max {|x[k]-x[k-1]|} is less than th, stop
# and report x[k].
# Next, we provide the elements of Matrix A row-wise, one element every
# line. Every element is signed and is given in decimal basis with 
# floating-point option if needed. 
# In the following example, we assume A=[1, 2; 3.5, -2.75].
# First, element A[0,0]
1
# Next, element A[0,1]
2
# A[1,0]
3.5
# A[1,1]]
-2.75
# After feeding A to the program, we start feeding Vector b in the 
# same manner as we did with A (floating-point, decimal, one element 
# every line)
# b[0]
5.5
# b[1]
-2.9
# That's it! Complete input file. Now take a look at how the ouptut file
# should be formatted.
